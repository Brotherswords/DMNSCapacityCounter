# DMNSCapacityCounter
- App used to compute and store metric information regarding exhibit counts.
- Used Firebase on the backend to store information, such as number people per day, currently, at different times etc. 
- Most relavent files (classes, structs and general logic) stored within DMNS Capacity Counter folder. 

Note: This project is years old and my coding skills have improved significantly since then. Furthermore, as this app is no longer employed at the museum the original database is no longer active.
